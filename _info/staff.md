  <h3> Peter Master (TA)</h3>
    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Peter Master and I'm a 4th year Computer Science BS/MS student from Walnut Creek, California. I had almost no coding experience before college, but I was inspired by the problem solving and interesting concepts that programming involved and the unmatched power to create and create at scale with little overhead that programming offers. I've interned at Google in Mountain View and a couple local start-ups, and I'm working on developing a sequential proof of work algorithm. I took a gap year to pursue technical-based financial market trading full time. I'm involved with the technology management program at UCSB, and I enjoy reading books and blogs about cognitive biases, risk, gamification, product, and best practices. I also enjoy weightlifting, writing, fasting, Chess, PC games, and playing tennis, basketball, and soccer. I'm looking forward to working with you all as a TA and hope that you can find some enjoyment, interest, and maybe even inspiration in the material as I did."</i>

    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Diego Segundo and I’m a 4th year computer science major originally from Huntington Beach California. I first was introduced to coding in high school and was drawn towards the creative aspect of coding and how there are so many different ways to solve one problem. For the last couple years I have worked as a web developer at the Daily Nexus (which is a school newspaper here at ucsb). I originally started mentoring in the spring of last year, and think that it is a great program that provides undergraduates with an extra opportunity to help them understand the course material. So far I have mentored for CS8 and CS56 (both for Professor Conrad). Outside of school my hobbies include playing basketball and surfing. This is my first quarter mentoring for cs16 and I am really looking forward to it!" </i>

    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Ben Ye, I'm a 2nd-year CS major. I went into UCSB with little to no prior coding experience, so I can definitely relate to people who may have trouble picking up the first steps in coding with C++. CS16 was a very integral part of my CS learning process since it lay the foundation and backbone for subsequent CS courses. If you have any questions then feel free to ask away, I'm more than happy to help you. In my spare time, I like to go to costco and eat, go home and eat, and eat before I sleep. I really like to eat food and I go to the gym sometimes." </i>

Seeing the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) based technology, I have now become a deep believer of deep learning, and is willing to see it transform our society day to days. In my spare time, I love to stay close to the ocean/ forest, travel to exotic countries, try out new food or just being Californian:) Reach out with any questions you have, and I will see you guys more in the lab, office hours, and lectures!
