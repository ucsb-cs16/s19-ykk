# Recap

There are 3 different ways to pass a variable into a function

Let's look at how we could implement `initBox()` that takes a box and initializes its member variables to 0.

* Pass by value -- `void initBox(Box b)`

A local copy of a box will be created, any changes within the function are not applied to the original object passed in.
The local copy is lost after the function returns.

* Pass by reference -- `void initBox(Box& b)`

A reference (nickname/alias) to an object is created. Memory management is highly efficient. Any changes to a local reference are applied to the original object as well. **Arrays are always passed by reference.**

* Pass by address (also called bass by pointer) -- `void initBox(Box* b)`

A pointer is created, which allows us to access the original object **through dereferencing**. Memory management is highly efficient.
If a box has a `width` member variable, access it either by `(*b).width` or `b->width`. The arrow operator `->` combines dereferencing and the dot operator and **_provides access of the members of a struct_**.


* A reminder about the asterisk operator (`*`)

When you use `*` to declare a variable, you are creating *a pointer of the specified type*:
`char* ch` -> ch is a pointer to a `char` variable

When you use `*` anywhere else, you are **dereferencing a pointer**
```
char* ch;
char c = 'a';
ch = &c;
*ch = 'b' // c now holds a 'b' inside.
```

### Pointers 

Pointers are data types just like ints or chars, but instead of numbers and characters, **a pointer stores a memory address**.

Write this down somewhere you can see it while you are programming, and keep referencing this statement:
**a pointer stores a memory address** (represented by a hexadecimal value).

To create a pointer, specify the type of an object that the pointer will point to and add an _asterisk_ (`*`).
```cpp
int a = 80;
cout << &a << endl; //0x2a8c64d78a0a
int* p; //p (a pointer to an integer) was created
p = &a; //p now stores the address of a.
cout << p << endl; //0x2a8c64d78a0a, same address as above
```

* Notice that we did not have to print `&p` to get the location of `a`. The pointer `p` already stores it as its value (because a pointer stores a memory address), just like `a` stores 80 as its value.

What can we do with pointers? Well, we can access the things they point to using the asterisk.
```cpp
int a = 80;
int* p = &a;
cout << p << endl; //0x2a8c64d78a0a
cout << *p << endl; //80
```

__This is very important__
* When you access `p`, you access **the memory address** stored in `p`
* When you access `*p`, you access **the variable** stored **at the memory address** that is in `p`.

This process of getting the variable stored in memory, which is pointed to by the address stored inside a pointer, is called **_dereferencing_ a pointer**.

Look at the last example with `a` and `p`.
`*p` is equivalent to `a`.
Why? Because `p == (&a)`, so `*p == *(&a)`
This command is saying: "Get me the address of `a` (`&a`), and then get me what's stored at that address (`a`)"

Let's see how we can solve the same problem of swapping variables, this time, using pointers:

```cpp
// swap-ptr.cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void swapValue(int* x, int* y){
    cout << "x = " << x << endl;  // address of a
    cout << "*x = " << *x << endl; // value stored at a
    cout << "y = " << y << endl; // address of b
    cout << "*y = " << *y << endl; // value stored at b
    cout<< "&x = " << &x <<"  "<< "&y = " << &y <<endl;
    // the above line prints the address of the *pointers* x and y
    // note that their addresses are different from the *values* (which are addresses) stored at x and y
    // remember that the addresses of a and b that we printed are the *values*/addresses stored at x and y
    
    int tmp = *x; //tmp stores 30
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;
}

int main() {
    int a=30, b=40;
    cout << "=== Before the swap ===" << endl;
    cout<< a <<"  "<< b <<endl;
    swapValue( &a, &b); //passing LOCATIONS OF a and b
    cout << "=== After the swap ===" << endl;
    cout<< a <<"  "<< b <<endl;
    cout<< "&a = " << &a <<"  "<< "&b = " << &b <<endl;
}
```

The following assignments took place "under the hood" during the call to `swapValue`:
```cpp
int* x = &a;
int* y = &b;
```

We accessed the values stored in `a` and `b` by *dereferencing* `x` and `y` pointers, which store the locations of `a` and `b` respectively.


Let's pause and review what we've learned:
* Pointers store locations/addresses of variables
* To create pointers, you need to specify the type of object it will point to (int, char, string), and use the asterisk sign (`*`)
* To store a variable's location, use the ampersand sign (`&`) from earlier:
```cpp
int* p = a; //p is a pointer to a, p stores a's location
```
* Pointers CAN change what they point to!
```cpp
int a = 10, c = 9;
int* p; //p (pointer) was just created
p = &a; //p points to a
cout << "*p: " << *p << endl; //10
p = &c; //p now points to c
cout << "*p: " << *p << endl; //9
```


Make sure this also makes sense and you understand when to use `&` and `*`, and what vaue each would provide.


## Pointers and arrays

When we learned about arrays, we promised to come back to them once we've leanred about pointers. Here we are.
The variable declared as an array is actually just **a pointer to the first element**.
```cpp
int arr[] = {5,4,3}; // arr points to the first element (currently 5)
cout << arr << endl; //0x2a8c64d78a14
cout << &(arr[0]) << endl; // same as `arr`, 0x2a8c64d78a14
```
Note that when you run the above code, you will get different values, because the compiler will assign variables to different memory locations.

* To get *the first element* of the array, we would type `arr[0]`
  * This is equivalent to `*arr`
* To get *the second element*, we would type `arr[1]`
  * This is equivalent to `*(arr+1)`
  * This is what is called **pointer arithmetic**, and it is used to get to other locations around the given starting point.
* When we learned about arrays, we said that it was important that all elements in an array were adjacent in memory. This is why: only in this case using pointer arithmetic helps us traverse through an array. 

* For those of you who want to know the specifics:
  * Remember how value of `arr` in the code above was 0x2a8c64d78a14?
  * This tells us that the first element is at location 0x2a8c64d78a14.
  * The size of one integer is 4 bytes, so the second element is at location 0x2a8c64d78a18.
  * The third element of arr is at location 0x2a8c64d78a1c (hexadecimal addition: 18 -> 19 -> 1a -> 1b -> 1c)

## Important Facts About pointers:

  * When pointers are **declared**, they hold **junk values**. Defererencing such pointers (i.e., using `*`) is dangerous, because their values are not properly initialized, which means that they do not hold a valid memory location. It might, depending on what's inside, tamper with your data, or attempt to reach something that the pointer doesn't have access to, causing a segmentation fault.
  * The best solution is to always initialize your pointer to `NULL` (`int* p = NULL;` which is the same as `int* p = 0;` but `NULL` is preferred to make it unambiguous that you are working with a pointer.)
  * Pointers are used to travel to a different world called "heap"
  * We will be using pointers a lot, so it is important that you are comfortable switching between using *the value* stored in the pointer vs the value/variable *stored at the location* that is stored in the pointer.
  * One thing about setting a pointer `NULL` is that dereferencing it would cause a segmentation fault, so always beware when dereferencing a pointer, and make sure it's not `NULL`
  
## Heap

Memory can be allocated in 2 ways, on the stack or the heap. On the stack, memory is automatically managed; any variables that are no longer in use (based on its scope) is automatically deallocated. However, memory on the stack is static, which means the compiler must know how much memory to allocate at compile time.

This can cause problems if you try to create objects on the memory as the program progresses.

Memory on the heap on the other hand is dynamically allocated. This means that the heap can allow an unknown amount of memory to be used. Because the heap memory is dynamically allocated, memory needs to be manually allocated and deallocated.

To allocate memory on the heap, use the `new` keyword.

To deallocate memory on the heap, use the `delete` keyword (or `delete[]` for arrays).

One really important point about objects declared on the heap: unlike memory on the stack, that has a name, objects allocate on the heap doesn't necessary have a name, they only have a pointer pointing to that memory on the heap. (See memory leaks on the next lecture about why we want to deallocate memory on the heap).

Example:
```
//Assume everything has been properly declared

int *x = new int(5);    //line 1:   declares an integer object with value 5 on the heap
cout << *x << endl;     //line 2:   dereference the pointer, and print the value that x is pointing to, which should print 5
delete x;               //line 3:   deallocate the memory on the heap

```

## Final notes

Pointers and references are confusing! They are arguably the hardest topic of the course, and are used a lot in C++.
They are not intuitive, and may not make sense at first. That's okay. We will be using them a lot, and it will get better. Use the resourses you have and ask for help. Don't wait until the week of the midterm.

**Key concepts**:
* A **pointer stores a memory address** (represented by a hexadecimal value). 
* To access an address/reference, use the ampersand `&`
* To **dereference a pointer** use an asterisk `*`; doing so will access **the variable** stored **at the memory address** that is stored by the pointer


### Code from Lecture

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  
    double* iptr = NULL;
    double val = 42;
    double arr[5] = {5,4,3}; // arr points to the first element (currently 5)
    cout << arr << endl; //0x2a8c64d78a14
    cout << &(arr[0]) << endl;

    iptr = &val;

    iptr = arr;
    for (int i=0; i < 5; i++)
    {
      //arr[i] = 2*i;
      //cout << arr[i] << endl;
      
      //*(iptr+i) = 2*i;   // not changing the location of the pointer
      
      iptr = iptr + i;  // changes the location of the pointer
      *iptr = 2*i;
      cout << iptr + i << endl;
    }

  return 0;
}


/* The example below started as a pointer to a double,
    hence the name dptr, and evolved to be a pointer to
    a Box variable. */

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Box {
  int x;
  int y;
};

int main() {
  
    Box* dptr = NULL;

    dptr = new Box;
    (*dptr).x = 42;
    dptr->y = 16;

    //delete [] dptr;  // how to delete arrays

  return 0;
}
```

## Conceptual questions:
1. What do pointers specifically store?
2. Can pointers store any data type? If not, explain.
3. Can you initialize a pointer to 0 and what does that represent?
4. What happens if you declare a pointer w/o initialization and dereference it?
5. Compare/Contrast Pass by value vs Pass by reference vs Pass by address (also called pass by pointer)
6. Is an array that you declared a pointer? If so, what does it point to?
