# Final Exam

## Time and Location

 Final Examination: Wednesday, June 12, 2019 7:30 PM - 10:30 PM
 
 Location: Chem 1179 (usual lecture room)
 
 Closed book. No notes other than a single A4 sheet with notes (double-sided); handwritten is preferred, but typed is OK. **Write your name and PERM # in the top RIGHT** corner of the sheet **on BOTH sides**.  Turn it in with your exam.
 
 
 Absolutely no electronic devices: please, take off your smart watches and other removable electronics.  Turn off your devices or put them on SILENT (not vibrate!) before the exam.
 
 
 Bring your **student ID**, not a driver's license or another form of ID.
 
 Write legibly and include your name or PERM # on every single page of your exam: failure to do so can result in a score of 0.

 Good luck!
